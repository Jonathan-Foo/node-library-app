# Features :sparkles:

- Create authors and catalogue their books
- Delete books and authors(only if they have no books in the database)

# Technologies :hammer_and_wrench:
### BackEnd
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- EJS 

# Challenges and Learnings :books:
The library app allowed me to learn and familiarize myself with the process of building a RESTFUL API. The skills I really honed while creating this app, was using Mongoose for querying and working with MongoDB, creating a interactive user interface using the EJS view engine, and deploying an app using Heroku services.

### Future Features
- Implement React front end
- Ratings
- Comments
